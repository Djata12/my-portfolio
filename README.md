## 🧠 Development Insights
Building this dashboard, I focused on the **user experience for local shop owners**. In the Ghanaian context, many users manage their businesses via mobile devices on 3G/4G networks. 
* **Optimization:** I used Vite for near-instant load times and minimized external CSS weight by using Tailwind.
* **Logic:** The search functionality is handled client-side to ensure zero-latency feedback for the user.
